In a double-blind study, we enrolled 1,663 patients who had severe heart failure, a left ventricular ejection fraction of no more than 35 percent, and were being treated with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, a loop diuretic, and in most cases digoxin. A total of 822 patients were randomly assigned to receive 25 mg of spironolactone daily and 841 to receive placebo. The primary endpoint was death from all causes.\nResults:\nThe trial was discontinued early, after a mean follow-up period of 24 months, because an interim analysis determined that spironolactone was efficacious. There were 386 deaths in the placebo group (46%) and 284 in the spironolactone group (35%; relative risk of death, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.82; p<0.001). This 30 percent reduction in the risk of death among patients in the spironolactone group was attributed to a lower risk of both death from progressive heart failure and sudden death from cardiac causes. The frequency of hospitalization for worsening heart failure was 35% lower in the spironolactone group than in the placebo group (relative risk of hospitalization, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.54 to 0.77; p<0.001). In addition, patients who received spironolactone had a significant improvement in the symptoms of heart failure, as assessed on the basis of the New York Heart Association functional class (p<0.001). Gynecomastia was reported in 10% of men who were treated with spironolactone, as compared with 1% of men in the placebo group (p<0.001).

This 30% reduction in the risk of death among patients in the spironolactone group was attributed to a lower risk of both death from progressive heart failure and sudden death from cardiac causes. The frequency of hospitalization for worsening heart failure was 35% lower in the spironolactone group than in the placebo group (relative risk of hospitalization, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.54 to 0.77; P<0.001). In addition, patients who received spironolactone had a significant improvement in the symptoms of heart failure, as assessed on the basis of the New York Heart Association functional class (P<0.001). Gynecomastia or breast pain was reported in 10% of men who were treated with spironolactone, as compared with 1 percent of men in the placebo group (P<0.001). The incidence of serious hyperkalemia was minimal in both groups of patients.\nTo which of the following patients are the results of this clinical trial applicable?\nchoices: {'A': 'An 82-year-old female with NYHA class II heart failure with an LVEF of 22%, taking lisinopril, furosemide, and digoxin', 'B': 'A 65-year-old male with newly diagnosed NYHA class IV heart failure and a LVEF of 21%, about to begin medical therapy', 'C': 'A 56-year-old male with NYHA class III heart failure with an LVEF of 32%, current taking lisinopril, furosemide, and digoxin', 'D': 'An 86-year-old female recently found to have an LVEF of 34%, currently taking furosemide and carvedilol', 'E': 'A 78-year-old male with NYHA class II heart failure and LVEF 36%'}\nquestion对应的正确选项的大写字母序号为：",

She notes that five days ago, her right breast began to hurt, and the skin near her nipple turned red. She also states that she has felt feverish and generally achy for 2 days but thought she was just sleep deprived. The patient’s son has been having difficulty latching for the last 2 weeks and has begun receiving formula in addition to breast milk, though the patient wishes to continue breastfeeding. She is generally healthy with no past medical history but has smoked half a pack per day for the last 15 years. Her mother died from breast cancer at the age of 62, and her father has hypertension and coronary artery disease. At this visit, her temperature is 100.6° F (38.1° C), blood pressure is 116/73 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 14/min. She appears tired and has a slightly flat affect. Examination reveals a 4x4 cm area of erythema on the lateral aspect near the nipple on the right breast. In the center of this area, there is a fluctuant, tender mass that measures 2x2 cm. The overlying skin is intact. The remainder of her exam is unremarkable. Which of the following is the best next step in management?\nchoices: {'A': 'Mammogram', 'B': 'Incision and drainage', 'C': 'Cessation of breastfeeding', 'D': 'Needle aspiration and oral dicloxacillin', 'E': 'Cessation of smoking'}\nquestion对应的正确选项的大写字母序号为：",

In 2017, there were 1,500 live births and, upon further inspection of the birth certificates, 108 of these children had a low birth weight (i.e. lower than 2,500 g), while 237 had mothers who smoked continuously during pregnancy. Further calculations have shown that the risk of low birth weight in smokers was 14% and in non-smokers, it was 7%, while the relative risk of low birth weight linked to cigarette smoking during pregnancy was 2%. In other words, women who smoked during pregnancy were twice as likely as those who did not smoke to deliver a low-weight infant. Using this data, you are also asked to calculate how much of the excess risk for low birth weight, in percentage terms, can be attributed to smoking. What is the attributable risk for smoking leading to low birth weight?\nchoices: {'A': '10%', 'B': '20%', 'C': '30%', 'D': '40%', 'E': '50%'}\nquestion对应的正确选项的大写字母序号为：",

Three hundred patients who received TAVR and another 300 patients who received SAVR were followed for 5 years and monitored for cardiovascular symptoms and all-cause mortality. The study found that patients who received TAVR had a higher risk of death at the end of a 5-year follow-up period (HR = 1.21, p < 0.001). Later, the researchers performed a subgroup analysis by adjusting their data for ejection fraction. After the researchers compared risk of death between the TAVR and SAVR groups among patients of the same ejection fraction, they found that TAVR was no longer associated with a higher risk of death. They concluded that ejection fraction was a potential confounding variable.

We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effect of eplerenone, a selective aldosterone blocker, on morbidity and mortality among patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure.\nMethods: Patients were randomly assigned to eplerenone (25 mg per day initially, titrated to a maximum of 50 mg per day; 3,319 patients) or placebo (3,313 patients) in addition to optimal medical therapy. The study continued until 1,012 deaths occurred. The primary endpoints were death from any cause, death from cardiovascular causes, hospitalization for heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or ventricular arrhythmia.\nResults: During a mean follow-up of 16 months, there were 478 deaths in the eplerenone group and 554 deaths in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.85; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.75 to 0.96; p = 0.008). Of these deaths, 407 in the eplerenone group and 483 in the placebo group were attributed to cardiovascular causes (relative risk, 0.83; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 0.94; p = 0.005). The rate of the other primary endpoint, death from cardiovascular causes, or hospitalization for cardiovascular events was reduced by eplerenone (relative risk, 0.87; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.79 to 0.95; p = 0.002), as was the secondary endpoint of death from any cause or any hospitalization (relative risk, 0.92; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.86 to 0.98; p = 0.02). There was also a reduction in the rate of sudden death from cardiac causes (relative risk, 0.79; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.64 to 0.97; p = 0.03). The rate of serious hyperkalemia was 5.5 percent in the eplerenone group and 3.9 percent in the placebo group (p = 0.002), whereas the rate of hypokalemia was 8.4 percent in the eplerenone group and 13.1 percent in the placebo group (p < 0.001).\nWhich of the following statements represents the most accurate interpretation of the results from the aforementioned clinical trial?\nchoices: {'A': 'There was no significant difference in the incidence of hyperkalemia between trial arms.', 'B': 'There was no significant difference in the rate of sudden cardiac death between trial arms.', 'C': 'Eplerenone, when added to optimal medical therapy, decreases all cause mortality in patients with left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction.', 'D': 'The rate of hypokalemia was not significantly different between trial arms.', 'E': 'The most common causes of death seen in enrolled patients over the course of this trial were non-cardiac in nature.'}\nquestion对应的正确选项的大写字母序号为：",

        "input": "question: In 2005, a group of researchers believed that prophylactically removing the ovaries and fallopian tubes (bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) in BRCA-mutation positive women would reduce the chance that they developed breast cancer. To test this hypothesis, they reviewed a database of women who were known to be BRCA-mutation positive and divided the group into those with breast cancer and those without breast cancer. They used data in the registry and surveys about peoples’ surgical history to compare the proportion of each population that had undergone a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Based on this data, they reported that women undergoing the procedure had a lower chance of developing breast cancer later in life with an odds ratio of 0.46.

        "input": "question: Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a) is a transcription factor with increased activity under conditions of cellular hypoxia. In normoxia, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein hydroxylates prolyl residues on oxygen-dependent degradation domains of HIF-1a, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Hydroxylation by VHL is inhibited under hypoxic conditions, allowing HIF-1a to escape degradation, dimerize with HIF-1ß, and translocate to the nucleus. This results in the upregulation of hypoxic response elements, leading to angiogenesis. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can mimic the hypoxic state to promote angiogenesis by inhibiting HIF-1a hydroxylation, even in the absence of hypoxia. A researcher wants to perform an experiment to detect HIF-1a in RCC under normoxic conditions with blotting techniques. Which of the following statements are most likely to be true regarding her experiment?\nchoices: {'A': 'A Northern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a hypoxic control cell.', 'B': 'A Northern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a normoxic control cell.', 'C': 'A Southern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a hypoxic control cell.', 'D': 'A Southern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a normoxic control cell.', 'E': 'A Western blot will show increased HIF-1α compared to a normoxic control.'}\nquestion对应的正确选项的大写字母序号为：",
